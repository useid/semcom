. Lifecycle?

== Reference implementations

. Repository and SDK built with web technologies
. Support for web components
. Trusted repositories

== Example

. Apps render a user's data
. Data is retrieved from the user's Solid pod
. The app queries the Semcom repository for components
. The app decides which component to use, and fetches the component's files
. The app initializes the component and renders the data
