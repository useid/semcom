== Specification and ecosystem

. Semcom is a specification
. We built a reference implementation of an SDK and repository
. Repositories contains metadata, but do not host code
. The SDK can be used by an app to query and render components
. Code can be downloaded from a host; like a cdn

== Semantic Components, code and metadata

. Component consists of code and metadata
. Code can be executed at runtime to render data
. Metadata describes the nature of a component
. Metadata can include inputs, outputs, purposes, runtime, license, version

== Repositories and hosts

. Repositories must expose metadata from one or all components through http get requests.
. Repositories must expose metadata of multiple components though Sparql requests.
. Repositories may return metadata in multiple RDF-serialization formats, but they must support JSON-LD.
. Repositories may download metadata from other (trusted) repositories.

== Example

. Apps render a user's data
. Data is retrieved from the user's Solid pod
. The app queries the Semcom repository for components
. The app decides which component to use, and fetches the component's code
. The app initializes the component and renders the data
