The goal of this project is to construct a decentralised registry to support the dynamic binding of semantic components in Solid data browsers. This registry is based on insights of practical solutions such as OpenComponents and Bit.dev while using theoretical building blocks such as linked data shapes as a foundation.

The source code of this project will be made available at https://github.com/digita-ai/semcom 

This project is also known as Solid-Shape.

This project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s H2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement no 871528.
