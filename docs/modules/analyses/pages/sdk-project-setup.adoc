=== Introduction

==== Overview

This specification is about the initial setup and configuration of the Angular project.

===== Components

For the SDK demo project we will generate a new Angular project using the latest version of Angular v11. Generate this new Angular project using the latest version of the angular CLI. To achieve this follow the instructions on https://angular.io/cli/new[Generate a new Angular project].

Install `ngx-translate` according to the https://github.com/ngx-translate/core[tutorial on Github].

Add NgRx to the project with `ng add @ngrx/store@latest` and follow the tutorial on https://ngrx.io/guide/store/install[NgRx]. Also configure `StoreModule` and `DevtoolsModule`, register these two in AppModule's `imports`. Create necessary effect, reducer and action files (following https://ngrx.io/docs[NgRx documentation]) and add `EffectsModule` in the `AppModule`'s imports as described https://ngrx.io/guide/effects#registering-root-effects[in the NgRx docs]. Add Angular material to the project using `ng add @angular/material` and follow the tutorial on https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started[angular.io]. Choose custom theme, set up global https://material.angular.io/guide/typography[Angular Material typography styles] and set up browser animations for Angular Material. Most of our component layout is done with https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/flex-layout[Flex-Layout]. (https://tburleson-layouts-demos.firebaseapp.com/#/docs[demos])

Create the custom theme using the instructions on https://material.angular.io/guide/theming[angular.io]. Below are the most important colors in Inox, but make sure to check the colors in Figma when creating components.

$color-primary-light: #F7F9FA;
$color-primary-normal: #70808F;
$color-primary-dark: #2F363C;
$color-accent-normal: #FF796E;

The remaining 2 tasks are adding a custom webpack builder and connecting the
router store.
Follow the tutorials on https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-builders/custom-webpack[Custom webpack builder] and https://ngrx.io/guide/router-store/install[Router store].

This list might not cover all necessary steps to get the project up and running. It contains the things that I think we will need later, but I probably did not think of everything.
